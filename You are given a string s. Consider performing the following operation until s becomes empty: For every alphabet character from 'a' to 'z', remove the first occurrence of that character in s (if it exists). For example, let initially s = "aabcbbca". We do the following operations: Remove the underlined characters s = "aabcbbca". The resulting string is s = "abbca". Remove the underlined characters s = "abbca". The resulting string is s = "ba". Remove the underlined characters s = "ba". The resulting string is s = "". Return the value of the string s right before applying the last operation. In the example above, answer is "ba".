24.You are given a string s. Consider performing the following operation until s becomes empty: For every alphabet character from 'a' to 'z', remove the first occurrence of that character in s (if it exists). For example, let initially s = "aabcbbca". We do the following operations: Remove the underlined characters s = "aabcbbca". The resulting string is s = "abbca". Remove the underlined characters s = "abbca". The resulting string is s = "ba". Remove the underlined characters s = "ba". The resulting string is s = "". Return the value of the string s right before applying the last operation. In the example above, answer is "ba".
def remove_letters(s):
    for char in sorted(set(s)):
        s = s.replace(char, '', 1)
    return s
s = "aabcbbca"
result = remove_letters(s)
print(result)
