23.You are given a string s. s[i] is either a lowercase English letter or '?'. For a string t having length m containing only lowercase English letters, we define the function cost(i) for an index i as the number of characters equal to t[i] that appeared before it, i.e. in the range [0, i - 1]. The value of t is the sum of cost(i) for all indices i. For example, for the string t = "aab":
cost(0) = 0
cost(1) = 1
cost(2) = 0
Hence, the value of "aab" is 0 + 1 + 0 = 1. Your task is to replace all occurrences of '?' in s with any lowercase English letter so at the value of s is minimized.
from collections import Counter
def minimize_string_value(s):
    def cost(i, char_count):
        return sum(count for char, count in char_count.items() if char == s[i])
min_value = float('inf')
    for c in range(26):
        char_count = Counter()
        value = 0
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] == '?':
                value += cost(i, char_count)
            else:
                char_count[s[i]] += 1
        min_value = min(min_value, value)
return min_value
s = "a?b?c"
result = minimize_string_value(s)
print(result)
