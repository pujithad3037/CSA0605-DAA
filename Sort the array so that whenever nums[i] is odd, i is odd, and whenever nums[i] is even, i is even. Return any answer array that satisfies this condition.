20.Sort the array so that whenever nums[i] is odd, i is odd, and whenever nums[i] is even, i is even. Return any answer array that satisfies this condition.
def sort_array_by_parity(nums):
    odd = [x for x in nums if x % 2]
    even = [x for x in nums if x % 2 == 0]
    return [even.pop(0) if i % 2 == 0 else odd.pop(0) for i in range(len(nums))]
